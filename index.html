          Kingdom Hearts is the first game in the Kingdom Hearts series developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square Co., LTD) for PlayStation 2 and directed by Tetsuya Nomura. This action RPG game began as a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive Studios and feature a cast of Disney voice actors. The game was very well-received for mixing action and RPG gameplay elements and for incorporating Disney, Final Fantasy, and the game's own original characters.
        </p> 

        <p class="paragraph">
          The game revolves around a fourteen-year old boy named Sora and details his adventures after his home-world is destroyed by sinister creatures known as the Heartless. It follows his attempts to restore his world and reunite with his friends, and in the process, he meets many characters from classic Disney films and from the Final Fantasy video game series. The main theme song for the game is "Simple and Clean", performed by Utada Hikaru.

          The universe of Kingdom Hearts is a collection of various levels, referred to as "worlds", through which the player must progress. Fourteen worlds out of which thirteen can be accessed in the game and one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters but are inaccessible because they have been destroyed by the Heartless. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the Disney animated features canon, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The graphics and characters of each world were designed to resemble the artwork style of each Disney film. Each Disney world is           inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar          in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the world are unaware of other ones,         with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.

        <p class="paragraph">
          The worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or           ones from several Final Fantasy games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves          as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the Final Fantasy characters call home; and the End of the         World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless The main characters travel from world          to world to seal each "Keyhole"; this protects the world from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize        their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation.This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy        to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance.
